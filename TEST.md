<summary><h2>Step 1: Add headers</h2></summary>

_Welcome to "Communicate using Markdown"! :wave:_

**What is _Markdown_?** Markdown is a [lightweight syntax](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for communicating on GitHub. You can format text to add heading, lists, **bold**, _italics_, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Comments in [issues](https://docs.github.com/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues), [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and [discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Sharing snippets of text in [Gists](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

**What is a _header_?** A header is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

### Example

```txt
# This is an <h1> header, which is the largest
## This is an <h2> header
###### This is an <h6> header, which is the smallest
```

#### How it looks

# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest
## This is an `<h2>` header
###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit your file with headers

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Open the **pull requests** tab.
1. Open the pull request we made for you.
1. In this pull request, go to the **Files changed** tab.
1. Select **Edit file** from the three dotted **...** menu in the upper right corner of the file view on `index.md`.
1. On the **Edit file** tab, add a `#`, followed by a **space**, before the content to make it an H1 Header. You can add more headers, using one to six `#` characters followed by a **space**.
1. Above your new content, click **Preview**.
1. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.
1. Click **Commit changes**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<summary><h2>Step 2: Add an image</h2></summary>

_Great job adding headers to the file :sparkles:_

Let's add an image. Include descriptive text in the square brackets. This text is read aloud for people using screen readers. It's also shown at times when your image doesn't display, such as when there's a poor connection. You can see the syntax for images below:

### Example

```md
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
```

#### How it looks

<img alt="Image of Yaktocat" src=https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png width=400>

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding an image

1. As you did before, edit the `index.md` file in this pull request.
1. In the file, add the correct Markdown for your image of choice. Don't forget to include alt-text!
1. Use the **Preview** tab to check your Markdown formatting.
1. Commit your changes.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.
